# PyTorch SQuAD Project

## Overview
This repo is focused on demonstrating the application of PyTorch, a powerful and versatile deep learning framework, in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), this repository showcases how PyTorch can be used to build and train a question-answering model.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this repository is educational. It aims to illustrate the use of PyTorch for constructing solutions to NLP problems, especially in the context of question answering systems. It's important to note that this project does not utilize the most advanced and recent Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT or Llama-2. Instead, it focuses on the foundational aspects of NLP in PyTorch, providing a stepping stone for those looking to delve into more complex NLP applications.

## Scope
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation for training a question-answering model on the SQuAD dataset. It includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model definition using BERT from the Transformers library
- Training loop setup
- Evaluation metrics and testing procedures

## Comparative Learning
This repository complements my other project, the PyTorch MNIST Dataset (CNN) Application, which focuses on recognizing handwritten digits. Together, these repositories offer a comprehensive overview of using PyTorch for different types of deep learning applications - from image processing with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to NLP with Transformer models.

## Getting Started
To begin using this repository, clone it to your local machine and ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- Matplotlib (for plotting training progress)

## Usage
Follow the instructions and code within the repository to:
1. Load and preprocess the SQuAD dataset.
2. Define and train the BERT model for question answering.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
